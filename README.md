# Daemon Dash 2017
A health and nutrition tracker for UMD Students using UMD Dining Services' nutrition facts


## Running the app locally
Open two terminal sessions and run `mongod` in one and `node app.js` in another. The app will be hosted at `localhost:3000`.


## What We Created
- [UMD Dining API](http://github.com/nickpesce/umdDiningApi), which we used to grab data from Dining Service's website
- QR Code Scanner to read in QR codes that can be posted with each food item at the diner
- MongoDB backend store for user data and daily health digest with consumption
- Full menu display and search capabilities


## Future Features
- Rating system
- Visualizations
  - Personal health digest
  - Overall student body consumption summary
  - Live visualization of food consumption
  - Nutritional comparison graphs (e.g. for different foods)
- Health apps/Fitbit integration
- Meal combinations and suggestions based on what other people get
